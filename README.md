# Domain and Motif Search

The sequences of genes, proteins, and entire genomes hold clues to their function. Repeated subsequences or sequences with a strong similarity to each other can be clues to things such as evolutionary conservation or functional relatedness. As such, sequence analysis for motifs and domains are core techniques in bioinformatics. Bioconductor contains many useful packages for analyzing genes, proteins, and genomes. Here, I will use Bioconductor to analyse sequences for features of functional interest, such as _de novo_ DNA motifs and known domains from widely used databases.

Outline:

* Finding DNA motifs
* Finding protein domains
* Performing multiple alignments
* Aligning genomic length sequences
* Machine learning for novel feature detection
* 3D structure protein alignment
